     <h4>A little extra:</h4>
                <p>Ive been playing magic for around 15 years and have always found it entertaining. Ive always loved to rollerblade, but think its hilarious that its ironic now. Finally, I can probably hold my breath for longer(Scuba diver), but didnt want to be too generous cause its been a minute</p>
    
        <h3>Interests, Aw yeeaah</h3>

            <ul>

                <li>Magic the Gathering, cause its fun</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>A little extra:</h4>
                <p>My dog is my life. Everyone thinks he is named Angus, like the beef. Its actually from the lead guitarist in AC/DC(Angus Young). I currently work for UPS as a supervisor. I need to move on and coding has been my main interest for a quite a while.</p>    
    
        <h3>Career Goals, Say What?!?</h3>

            </ul>

     <h4>A little extra:</h4>
                <p>My roommate first got me involved with coding. He was also the one who told me about DevMountain. Im very excited to start a new career and learn new skills. Changing careers was a dream, but now is becoming a reality. I can't wait to find my focus and achieve my goals. </p>
